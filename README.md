# Solid Gym Management ERP

**Project Link:** [https://github.com/obligator11/gym-management-system](https://github.com/obligator11/gym-management-system)

A desktop Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed for gym management. This project focuses on scaling a base architecture using modular OOP principles and integrating advanced hardware/AI features.

## 🚀 Key Technical Achievements
* **Modular OOP Architecture:** Re-architected the system to separate core logic from UI and hardware drivers.
* **Computer Vision (OpenCV):** Implemented real-time webcam capture for member profile creation.
* **Cloud Integration:** Automated database backups using the **Google Drive API**.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Built a "Rush Hour" analytics module to visualize peak gym times.
* **Biometric Architecture:** Designed the `fingerprint.py` driver interface to support future biometric scanners (currently pending hardware availability for final integration).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite (AI Module), Pandas
* **Architecture:** MVVM / Modular OOP

## ⚠️ Project Scope & Contribution
This project involves the complete re-engineering of a basic management system.

* **Base Foundation:** The initial prototype (Login, Basic CRUD, and Local Saving) was established by a partner.
* **My Engineering Contributions:** I was responsible for **architecting the entire system upgrade**. This included:
    * Refactoring the codebase into a scalable **Modular OOP / MVVM Architecture**.
    * Developing **all** advanced modules: AI Analytics, Computer Vision (OpenCV), Biometric Drivers, and Cloud Services.
    * Optimizing the application for real-world deployment.****
